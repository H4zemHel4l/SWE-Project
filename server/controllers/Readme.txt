K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is leveraged in this system to recommend books and categories tailored to individual preferences. The algorithm operates by identifying the books that are most similar to the user's preferences, utilizing a nearest neighbors approach. This ensures that the recommendations align closely with the user's taste and interests.

Controllers handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing the book database.
